# Product Requirements Document: Real-Time Multi-Tenant Event Feed System

## 1. Project Purpose

Build a real-time event broadcasting system that enables multiple tenants to send and receive events within their isolated streams, ensuring complete tenant separation while maintaining sub-second latency for event delivery.

**Core Value Proposition:** Provide isolated, real-time event streaming for multi-tenant applications without complex infrastructure dependencies.

## 2. User Stories

### Primary User Flows
- **As a tenant user**, I want to select my tenant identity so I can access my isolated event stream
- **As a tenant user**, I want to post events to my stream so other users in my tenant can see them in real-time
- **As a tenant user**, I want to see events from my tenant appear automatically so I stay informed of activities
- **As a tenant user**, I want to be assured that I never see events from other tenants so my data remains private
- **As a system administrator**, I want clear visual confirmation of tenant isolation so I can verify the system works correctly

### Edge Case Scenarios
- **As a tenant user**, I want my connection to gracefully handle network interruptions
- **As a tenant user**, I want to see a clear indication when new events arrive
- **As a developer**, I want clear setup instructions so I can deploy and test the system quickly

## 3. Key Features

### Core Functionality
- **Tenant Selection Interface**
  - Dropdown selection for "Tenant A" and "Tenant B"
  - Clear visual indication of current tenant context
  
- **Real-Time Event Stream**
  - Auto-updating event list via WebSocket connection
  - Chronological event ordering (newest first)
  - Visual indicators for new event arrivals
  
- **Event Publishing**
  - Simple form interface for posting new events
  - Immediate feedback on successful event submission
  - Input validation and error handling
  
- **Tenant Isolation Engine**
  - Strict event segregation by tenant ID
  - WebSocket connection scoping per tenant
  - Header-based tenant authentication

### Data Management
- **In-Memory Event Storage**
  - Per-tenant event collections
  - UUID-based event identification
  - Timestamp tracking for chronological ordering

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance Standards
- **Real-Time Latency:** Events must appear in UI within 1 second of posting
- **Connection Handling:** Support multiple concurrent WebSocket connections per tenant
- **Memory Efficiency:** Reasonable memory usage for in-memory storage (development-grade)

### User Experience
- **Visual Clarity:** Clear tenant context indication at all times
- **Error Handling:** Graceful degradation when WebSocket connection fails
- **Browser Compatibility:** Modern browser support (ES6+)

### System Reliability
- **Tenant Isolation:** Zero cross-tenant data leakage (critical security requirement)
- **Connection Recovery:** Automatic reconnection handling for WebSocket drops
- **Input Validation:** Server-side validation for all event data

## 5. Technical Stack

### Backend Infrastructure
- **Runtime:** Node.js (Latest LTS)
- **Framework:** Express.js
- **WebSocket Library:** Socket.io or native WebSocket
- **Authentication:** Specified by 'X-Tenant-ID' in the header
- **Storage:** In-memory data structures (Map/Object collections)

### Frontend Technology
- **Core Language:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Styling:** CSS3 (no framework dependencies)
- **Communication:** WebSocket API + Fetch API for REST calls
- **Build Process:** None required (pure static files)

### Development Tools
- **Package Management:** npm
- **Process Management:** nodemon (development)
- **Code Quality:** ESLint

## 6. Data Model Specification

```json
{
  "id": "uuid-v4-string",
  "tenant_id": "tenant_a | tenant_b", 
  "message": "string (max 500 chars)",
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601 datetime string"
}
```

## 7. API Specification

### REST Endpoints
- **POST /events**
  - Headers: `X-Tenant-ID: {tenant_id}`
  - Body: `{"message": "event description"}`
  - Response: `201 Created` with event object

### WebSocket Events
- **Connection:** `/ws?tenant={tenant_id}`
- **Event Types:**
  - `event_created`: New event broadcast to tenant connections
  - `connection_established`: Confirmation of successful tenant connection

## 8. Deployment Requirements

### Development Environment
- **Runtime Requirements:** Node.js 18+ 
- **Port Configuration:** HTTP server on port 3000, WebSocket on same port
- **File Structure:** Static frontend files served from `/public`
- **Setup Complexity:** Single `npm install && npm start` command
- **Packaging:** Docker Image

### Production Considerations (Out of Scope)
- Database persistence layer
- Horizontal scaling and load balancing
- SSL/TLS termination
- Container orchestration
- Monitoring and logging infrastructure

## 9. Project Scope Definition

### ✅ In Scope
- Multi-tenant event broadcasting with strict isolation
- Real-time WebSocket communication
- Simple web-based frontend with tenant selection
- In-memory event storage and management
- Aauthentication via tenant headers
- Development-ready setup and documentation.
- Support for exactly 2 tenants (A and B)

### ❌ Out of Scope
- Database persistence (events lost on server restart)
- Complex user authentication (JWT, OAuth, etc.)
- Event history pagination or search
- Event editing or deletion capabilities
- Production deployment configuration
- Horizontal scaling or clustering
- Advanced error logging or monitoring
- Support for dynamic tenant creation
- Event replay or catch-up mechanisms
- WebSocket fallback mechanisms (long-polling, etc.)

## 10. Success Criteria & Validation

### Functional Verification
- **Tenant Isolation Test:** Two browser windows with different tenants show completely separate event streams
- **Real-Time Delivery:** Events posted in one tenant window appear in other same-tenant windows within 1 second
- **Cross-Tenant Verification:** Events from Tenant A never appear in Tenant B windows and vice versa

### Technical Validation
- **Code Quality:** Clean, documented codebase with clear setup instructions
- **Developer Experience:** New developer can run system locally within 5 minutes
- **Browser Testing:** Functional verification across Chrome, Firefox, and Safari
